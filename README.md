Business Insights 360 is a multi-functional dashboard aiming at providing relevant insights to different business function including: **Sales, Finance, Marketing, Supply Chain** and more. The insights presented here are based on Datas from [AtliQ Technologies](https://www.atliq.com/), a leading IT solution services provider in India and the USA. As the company is growing rapidly in the recent years, managers decided to implement `Data Analytics` in order to have a broader understanding of their business and make `Data driven decision`. To that effect, we went through a `project managment` process that allows us to discuss the project requirements with the stakeholders.So far, stakeholders provided **Rough Project Mockup** that we used to build different `dashboard` using [Microsoft Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/).

📂 Here's a quick look at the dashboards:
- 🏠 Home - An overview of all the Pages.
